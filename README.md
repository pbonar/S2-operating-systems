# Operating Systems Algorithms in Java

This project implements various algorithms related to computer systems, focusing on process management and distributed systems. Developed in Java, it serves as a practical demonstration of key concepts in operating systems.

## Features

- Implementation of process management algorithms:
  - Process scheduling (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin)
  - Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms
  - Deadlock detection and prevention

- Algorithms for distributed systems:
  - Distributed mutual exclusion
  - Distributed deadlock detection
  - Resource allocation in distributed environments

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
